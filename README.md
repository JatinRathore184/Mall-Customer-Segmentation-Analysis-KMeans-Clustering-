# Mall Customer Segmentation (KMeans Clustering)

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** to perform customer segmentation on mall customers.  
Using **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn**, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer demographics and spending behavior.  
The **Elbow Method** was used to determine the optimal number of clusters, followed by applying **KMeans clustering** on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.  
Clusters were visualized through scatter plots and heatmaps, making the insights easy to interpret.  
**Business Insight:** High-income, high-spending customers were identified as the prime target group for marketing strategies.
